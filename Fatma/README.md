# Fatma's Python Projects: Handwritten Digit Recognition

This directory contains Python projects developed by Fatma, primarily focusing on **handwritten digit recognition** using machine learning techniques. It showcases practical applications of deep learning frameworks for image classification.

## Projects

### 1. Handwritten Digit Classification (`main.py` and `فاطمه محمود حاتم الكوراني.py`)

-   **Overview:** This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of building, training, and evaluating deep learning models for image classification.
-   **Features:**
    -   Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
    -   Builds a sequential neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
    -   Trains the model and evaluates its performance.
    -   Visualizes training and validation accuracy/loss.
-   **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
-   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python "فاطمه محمود حاتم الكوراني.py"
    ```
    *(Note: Both files contain identical code for the handwritten digit classification project.)*
