This assignment includes two distinct Python functions:

-   **`second_largest(x)`:** A function designed to find the second largest number within a given list of numbers. It handles edge cases such as lists with fewer than two elements.
-   **`chars_mix_up(a, b)`:** A function that takes two strings as input, swaps their first two characters, and returns the two modified strings concatenated with a space in between.

## Getting Started
