# FEE_NOTES: Faculty of Electrionic Engineering Notes and Projects

`FEE_NOTES` is a comprehensive repository serving as a collection of academic notes, assignments, and projects from the Faculty of Engineering Education. It showcases a diverse range of topics, including C# programming fundamentals, Python-based data management systems, image processing, and cybersecurity.

## Overview

This repository is a testament to applied learning and problem-solving across various engineering and computer science disciplines. It compiles practical exercises, project implementations, and academic tasks, reflecting hands-on experience and theoretical understanding gained through coursework.

## Project Contents

-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
-   `Cybersecurity_finalTask.pdf`: A final task or report related to cybersecurity, likely focusing on a specific topic or case study.
-   `Image proccessing/`: A dedicated folder for image processing projects.
    -   `README.md`: Detailed documentation for the image processing projects.
-   `Fatma/`: Contains Python projects, including a handwritten digit recognition system.
    -   `README.md`: Detailed documentation for Fatma's Python projects.
-   `Maher's python/`: Contains Python assignments and exercises.
    -   `README.md`: Detailed documentation for Maher's Python assignments.
-   `Task4.ipynb`: **Python-based Course Management System.** A Jupyter Notebook implementing a comprehensive system for managing students, courses, enrollments, and grades. It utilizes `pandas` for data handling and includes functionalities like calculating GPA, finding popular courses, and managing waitlists.
-   `ITI_task1.txt`: **Basic Input/Output & Addition (C#).** A C# console application that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then calculates and displays their sum.
-   `ITI_task2.txt`: **Arithmetic Operations & Operator Precedence (C#).** A C# console application that takes numerical inputs and performs various arithmetic calculations, demonstrating the use of different operators and their precedence.
-   `ITI_task3.txt`: **Increment/Decrement Operators (C#).** A C# console application illustrating the behavior of the post-increment operator (`x++`) and its effect on variable values within expressions.
-   `ITI_task4.txt`: **Conditional Logic & Boolean Expressions (C#).** A C# console application that takes numerical inputs and evaluates several boolean conditions (e.g., checking if numbers are equal, different, or if one is the largest/smallest, and comparing sum vs. product).

## Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated

-   **C# Programming:** Fundamental syntax, data types, control flow, console applications.
-   **Python Programming:** Functions, data structures, object-oriented programming, data manipulation with `pandas`.
-   **Machine Learning/Deep Learning:** (From `Fatma/main.py`) Neural networks, TensorFlow, Keras, MNIST dataset.
-   **Image Processing:** (From `Image proccessing` folder) OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, image enhancement techniques.
-   **Cybersecurity:** (From `Cybersecurity_finalTask.pdf`) Incident response, threat analysis, case study analysis.
-   **Data Management:** (From `Task4.ipynb`) Course and student management, data storage in CSV (implied).
-   **Academic Project Management:** Organization of diverse coursework and assignments.

## Getting Started

This repository primarily serves as a documentation and portfolio piece. To explore the projects, navigate to the respective folders and files.
